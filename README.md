<h2>About this project</h2>
this is a simple drawing app, inspired by MSPaint and Kleki.com. It’s meant to be fun, lightweight, and easy for anyone to pick up and start creating.

u don’t need to give credit if u are making a showcase like making a video, or talking about it — no pressure at all lol cuz all i ask is if u like it, just share the link so others can check it out too pls. Thanks for reading this, now go and enjoy lol
